### From Docker Hub

SkyWalking Python agent starts to provide convenient dockerfile 
and images for easy integration utilizing its [auto-bootstrap](CLI.md) capability.

Simply pull SkyWalking Python image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/skywalking-python)
based on desired agent version, protocol and Python version.
