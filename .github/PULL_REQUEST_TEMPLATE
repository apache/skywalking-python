<!--
- [ ] Add a test case for the new plugin

- [ ] Add a logo in [the UI repo](https://github.com/apache/skywalking-rocketbot-ui/tree/master/src/views/components/topology/assets)
- [ ] Add the library/module that this plugin instruments into the `setup.py` (`extras_require/test`), such as `pymysql`, `flask`, `django`, etc.
